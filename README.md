# DATA_STRUCTURES
This Repository contains some general implementations of Data Structures for Students new to Data structures like Linked list,Trees like BST,Recursion etc<br>
DoublyLinkedListDemo:<br>
This files contains the basic functionalities and implementations of Doubly Linked list like insertion,deletion,traversals etc
<br>Recursion:
<br>This files contains the basic functionalities and implementations of recursion like sorting, searching calculation etc
<br>BST:
<br>This files contains the basic functionalities and implementations of Binary Search Tree, it includes use of doubly linked list and recursion and shows multiple functions related to Trees and classes
<br>
<br>NOTE: Every Function is coded and use of built-in Functions is kept to minimum to provide knowledge of how many functions work.
