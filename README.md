# DATA_STRUCTURES
This Repository contains some general implementations of Data Structures for Students new to Data structures like Linked list,Trees like BST,Recursion etc
DoublyLinkedListDemo:
This files contains the basic functionalities and implementations of Doubly Linked list like insertion,deletion,traversals etc
Recursion:
This files contains the basic functionalities and implementations of recursion like sorting, searching calculation etc
BST:
This files contains the basic functionalities and implementations of Binary Search Tree, it includes use of doubly linked list and recursion and shows multiple functions related to Trees and classes

NOTE: Every Function is coded and use of built-in Functions is kept to minimum to provide knowledge of how many functions work.
